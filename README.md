# Game-of-Life

The [**Game of Life**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is a cellular automaton simulation developed by mathematician [John Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway). It consists of a grid of cells, where each cell is either alive or dead. The simulation evolves over time based on simple rules that dictate whether each cell should live, die, or be born based on the state of its neighboring cells. The project involves creating an interactive visualization of this simulation using Python and the Pygame library. The user can draw on the grid, start and stop the simulation, and observe the behavior of the evolving cells.
